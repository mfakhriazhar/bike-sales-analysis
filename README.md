# Bike Sales Analysis
Analyze bike sales data based on customer data to identify the characteristics of potential consumers and understand the factors that influence bicycle purchase decisions.

## Project Overview  
This project used a dataset of customer data to analyze bicycle purchase trends. The analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel, specifically with Pivot Tables to explore the relationship between demographic attributes (age, income, gender) and commuting habits on bicycle purchase decisions.  

## Data Overview  
This dataset contains demographic and behavioral information of a number of individuals who are targeted for bicycle purchase analysis. There are approximately 1000+ rows of data with each row representing one consumer. Important columns in this data include:
- ID: A unique number for each respondent.
- Marital Status: Marital status (S = Single, M = Married).
- Gender: Gender (M = Male, F = Female).
- Income: Annual income in dollars.
- Children: Number of children owned.
- Education: Last level of education.
- Occupation: Type of work (e.g. Professional, Clerical, Manual, etc.).
- Home Owner: Home ownership status (Yes/No).
- Cars: Number of cars owned.
- Commute Distance: Distance traveled to work (e.g. 0-1 Miles, 2-5 Miles, etc.).
- Region: Region of residence (Europe, Pacific, etc).
- Age: Age of the individual.
- Purchased Bike: Target variable, indicating whether the individual purchased a bike (Yes/No).

## Tools  
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Table

## Project Goals  
- Identify the profile of consumers who are likely to buy a bicycle.
- Analyze the influence of age, income, gender, and commuting distance on purchasing decisions.
- Provide insights that can be used to develop a more targeted marketing strategy.

## Insights  
- High income → more likely to buy: Bicycle buyers have a higher average income than non-buyers.
- Close proximity → high potential: Consumers who live <5 miles from work are more likely to buy a bicycle.
- Middle Age most potential: Working-age consumers dominate purchases.
- Male → strong dominance: More men are buying bicycles, especially with higher incomes.

## Conclusion  
The most potential consumers for bicycle products are productive-age males with upper-middle income who live close to the workplace. This analysis can be used to develop more targeted marketing strategies, such as targeting the productive age segment in residential areas near office areas.
